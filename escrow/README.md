# Escrow Smart Contract
The Escrow Smart Contract is designed for managing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within the context of a leaderboard system. It provides functionality to hold NFTs in escrow until certain conditions are met, either awaiting transfer to the rightful owner based on leaderboard standings or for burning (permanent removal) of the NFTs from circulation.
